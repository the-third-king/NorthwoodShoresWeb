    <h1>
        Breakdown of Expectations
    </h1>
    <ol>
        <li>We have made our website for a campground in Rice Lack called Northwood Shores Campground</li>
        <li>We have a Northwood Shores Campground header on every page with the slogan</li>
        <li>We have 10 different pages in the home, amenities, Rates, site map, seasonal sites, the lake, location , area attractions, photo gallery, and the contact pages</li>
        <li>We have a navigation bar on the left of every page</li>
        <li>We have css cards that shrink down the number of columns in that page.  Also our nav bar will shrink down to a hamburger menu when it is small enough.</li>
        <li>We mainly use css cards and the same nav bar and header on every page so it looks coherent.</li>
        <li>All images have an alt category.</li>
        <li>Every page has the same campfire favicon since it is a campground</li>
        <li>We have 2 folders for css and images and leave the html out in the parent folder for easy access to get to.</li>
        <li>We only used css and html.  There is a javascript file in here but that method is commented out for the time being.</li>
        <li>Every page passes the html and css validator.</li>
        <li>We have a github at <a href="https://github.com/the-third-king/NorthwoodShoresWeb" target="_blank">Northwood Shores Github</a>.</li>
        <li>All files are lowercase using alphanumeric letters only.</li>
        <li>All content is aligned in there own way to make pages look cohesive.</li>
        <li>We have 2 different font faces for the pages and for the header bar.</li>
        <li>we have links to external sites in the area attractions page and also a link to facebook in the footer.</li>
        <li>The source code is readable using understandable names.</li>
        <li>The nav bar is the same on every page and even when shrunk down it is consistent.</li>
        <li>Every webpage has a header and footer section with the navbar.</li>
        <li>We use mainly flexboxes in all of our pages.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1> Project Part 2 Expectations</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>All javascript files were placed in a folder called js</li>
        <li>We have four web pages implementing forms in the contact us page, available sites page, admin sign in page, and admin site changing page</li>
        <li>We have a photo carousel on the homepage as our javascript animation</li>
        <li>Our website uses MySQL using XAMPP do collect all of our data</li>
        <li>We implemented an admin sign in page with login (Username: admin, password: admin) for the admin to change campsite availability</li>
        <li>We addressed the feedback of our website colors being off, our text being too small, our navigation bar looking weird, and styling our webpages a little better</li>
    </ol>

        Critique from Client
    </h1>
    <p>The client was happy with what we showed them.  They just wanted the database to be fully completed with all of their data and we will do that when they decide to launch the website</p>
