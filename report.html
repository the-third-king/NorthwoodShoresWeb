        Breakdown of Expectations
    </h1>
    <ol>
        <li>We have made our website for a campground in Rice Lack called Northwood Shores Campground</li>
        <li>We have a Northwood Shores Campground header on every page with the slogan</li>
        <li>We have 10 different pages in the home, amenities, Rates, site map, seasonal sites, the lake, location , area attractions, photo gallery, and the contact pages</li>
        <li>We have a navigation bar on the left of every page</li>
        <li>We have css cards that shrink down the number of columns in that page.  Also our nav bar will shrink down to a hamburger menu when it is small enough.</li>
        <li>We mainly use css cards and the same nav bar and header on every page so it looks coherent.</li>
        <li>All images have an alt category.</li>
        <li>Every page has the same campfire favicon since it is a campground</li>
        <li>We have 2 folders for css and images and leave the html out in the parent folder for easy access to get to.</li>
        <li>We only used css and html.  There is a javascript file in here but that method is commented out for the time being.</li>
        <li>Every page passes the html and css validator.</li>
        <li>We have a github at <a href="https://github.com/the-third-king/NorthwoodShoresWeb" target="_blank">Northwood Shores Github</a>.</li>
        <li>All files are lowercase using alphanumeric letters only.</li>
        <li>All content is aligned in there own way to make pages look cohesive.</li>
        <li>We have 2 different font faces for the pages and for the header bar.</li>
        <li>we have links to external sites in the area attractions page and also a link to facebook in the footer.</li>
        <li>The source code is readable using understandable names.</li>
        <li>The nav bar is the same on every page and even when shrunk down it is consistent.</li>
        <li>Every webpage has a header and footer section with the navbar.</li>
        <li>We use mainly flexboxes in all of our pages.</li>
    </ol>
